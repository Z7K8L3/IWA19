## **BOOKCONNECT PROJECT**

As a junior JavaScript developer, I have been approached by a small startup called Book Connect. They run a social media platform specifically targeted at book enthusiasts. A basic version of the product was created by another freelance developer. The team was extremely impressed by their HTML and CSS code. However, it eventually became clear that the developer was not entirely honest about their competency with JavaScript.

The goal is to highlight areas where improvements can be made to performance, readability and future maintainability. I have to spend a week digging into the codebase and compile my recommendations into a slideshow to be presented to the team at the end of the week.

## **USER STORIES**

The client has provided me with prioritized user stories by means of the current backlog. These user stories express the product behaviour as intended, and the app will not be considered fixed unless all these user stories are met:

### **User Story 1: View Book Previews**
As a user, I want to view a list of book previews, by title and author, so that I can discover new books to read.

### **User Story 2: Images for Book Previews**
As a user, I want an image associated with all book previews so that I can recognize a book by the cover even if I forgot the name.

### **User Story 3: Read Book Summary**
As a user, I want to have the option of reading a summary of the book so that I can decide whether I want to read it.

### **User Story 4: View Published Date**
As a user, I want to have the option of seeing the date that a book was published so that I can determine how easy it is to obtain second-hand.

### **User Story 5: Search by Text Phrases**
As a user, I want to find books based on specific text phrases so that I donâ€™t need to remember the entire title of a book.

### **User Story 6: Filter by Author**
As a user, I want to filter books by author so that I can find books to read by authors that I enjoy.

### **User Story 7: Filter by Genre**
As a user, I want to filter books by genre so that I can find books to read in genres that I enjoy.

### **User Story 8: Toggle Dark/Light Modes**
As a user, I want to toggle between dark and light modes so that I can use the app comfortably at night.
